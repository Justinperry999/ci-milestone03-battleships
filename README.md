# **Battleships Game**

<img src="/documentation_assets/images/battleships_responsive.png" alt="Main readme photo">

Welcome to BattleShips, my third project. This project uses python to create a simple single player battleships game.

The aim of the game is to destroy all of the computer's ships using the 10 missiles provided. Each ship is takes up a 1x1 space.

The deployed version of the game can be found here.

## **User Experience (UX)**

### Project Goals

The main focus of Battleships is to create a entertaining game for the user that is both engaging and interactive. My project should display the basic use of the Python language.

### User Goals

First Time User

As a first-time user, I want to be engaged and enjoy playing the game.
As a first-time user, the game should spark a positive emotion.
As a first-time user, I would like the instruction to be clear so I fully understand how to play.
As a first-time user, the game shouldn't be to difficult to win.

Returning Visitor User

As a Returning Visitor, I want to have another enjoyable experience and win at the game.

### User Expectations

- The game is enjoyable to play.
- The rules are easy to follow.
- To want to come back and play again.

## Game Structure

In the design phase of my project I used [LucidChart](https://www.lucidchart.com/) to create the logic of my battleships game.

## How To Play Battleships

This is a simple version of the classic pen and paper game of battleships.

In this version, one board which is 5x5 is displayed to the user. 

On this board there have been placed 4 enemy ships which take up one space.

The user will have 15 guesses to try and destroy the 4 ships before losing the game.

Welcome,

This is the Code Institute student template for deploying your third portfolio project, the Python command-line project. The last update to this file was: **March 14, 2023**

## Reminders

- Your code must be placed in the `run.py` file
- Your dependencies must be placed in the `requirements.txt` file
- Do not edit any of the other files or your code may not deploy properly

## Creating the Heroku app

When you create the app, you will need to add two buildpacks from the _Settings_ tab. The ordering is as follows:

1. `heroku/python`
2. `heroku/nodejs`

You must then create a _Config Var_ called `PORT`. Set this to `8000`

If you have credentials, such as in the Love Sandwiches project, you must create another _Config Var_ called `CREDS` and paste the JSON into the value field.

Connect your GitHub repository and deploy as normal.

## Constraints

The deployment terminal is set to 80 columns by 24 rows. That means that each line of text needs to be 80 characters or less otherwise it will be wrapped onto a second line.

Happy coding!
